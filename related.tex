Hound is the work most closely related to Mesh~\cite{1542521}. Hound
is a memory leak detector that uses virtual memory remapping to merge
pages, a technique that Mesh adopts. Like Mesh, Hound uses a BiBoP
memory allocator. To isolate leaks, it allocates objects sequentially
and memory protects pages beyond a certain age (in allocation
time). Unlike most allocators (including Mesh), Hound does not reuse
freed slots on pages until the page becomes completely empty. This
lack of reuse could lead to catastrophic memory consumption, which
Hound attempts to bound by performing what we here call meshing
(merging old pages that have become mostly empty). Unlike Hound, Mesh
uses meshing for all pages, and its randomized allocation algorithm
ensures that compaction is likely to succeed with high probability.
