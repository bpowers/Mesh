\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper introduced \textbf{meshing}, a novel mechanism that
provides \textit{compaction without relocation} for unmanaged
languages.  Meshing eliminates memory fragmentation in languages like
C and C++ with high probability.

We think meshing is applicable both to unmanaged languages like C and
C++, but also potentially interesting for managed language runtimes
that don't have a clear path to supporting compaction, such as Go's
garbage collector.
